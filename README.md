The layout of the webpage looks very basic and simple. It was not my intention to be so when I first started building it but as I haven't been able to come up with anything more creative and interesting, at the end, the result is this layout.
I could've easily copy some youtube video but I wanted to build everything from scratch by myself. I didn't use any CSS library because, again, I wanted to test my CSS knowledge. Probably in the future, I will get my hands on either Taildwind or Bootstrap.
The website also has some basic Javascript functions, that were necessary for it to work hundred percent. I chose to do it this way, rather than in React, because I wanted to do one project with these basic languages and also because I feel more comfortable doing it this way.
I admit that the layout could've been much prettier and more complex and that is actually what I had in mind. However, during this project I realized that I'm not really creative in this way and I had a lot of difficulties coming up with anything original.
I finished half of the project atleast three times before deleting it and starting again just to realize around the middle of it that I don't like it. At the end, I came to conclusion that for now this is what I can do and I decided to stick to it and leave it as it is.
In my opinion, mobile version looks much better than desktop version. The code is far from perfect and it could be improved. Overall, the main goal of this project was to make my own website and have a personal internet presence, practice everything learned so far
and being able to have something when applying to jobs.
